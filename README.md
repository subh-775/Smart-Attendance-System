    <h1>🌟 Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition and OpenCV </h1>
    <h2>🔍 Here's how it works:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>📸 Image Capture:</h4> The system uses a camera to take input and matches it with available databases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>🤖 Face Recognition:</h4> Deep learning algorithms analyze these images to identify and verify the identities of the people present. The system compares the captured faces with a database of known individuals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>📋 Attendance Tracking:</h4> When a recognized face is detected, the system records the attendance. It can create a log or store the data in a spreadsheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>⏱️ Real-Time Processing:</h4> The entire process happens in real-time, allowing for efficient and accurate attendance management.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>⚙️ Installing Dependencies:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clone the Dlib repository from GitHub:
        <br>
        <span class="code">git clone https://github.com/z-mahmud22/Dlib_Windows_Python3.x.git</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Install a compatible version of numpy:
        <br>
        <span class="code">pip install numpy==1.26.0</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Install the face-recognition library:
        <br>
        <span class="code">pip install face-recognition</span>
      </li>
    </ol>
